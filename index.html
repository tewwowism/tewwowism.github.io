OK, burrow into the Deku Flower.
The game begins the moment you
jump out!

It looks like we have a visitor,
Honey.

I wonder if it's a customer,
Darling?

But from what I see, he doesn't
have a bow, Honey.

Oh...Then he can't play, can he,
Darling?

What should we do, Honey?
Surely this one doesn't have a
bow, so he can't play here...

Oh...Too bad. But, Darling, even if
he doesn't have a bow, he could
play if he had some sort of way
of shooting at things...

What shall we do, Honey?
I don't think this one can use a
bow...

But it looks like he can shoot
bubbles, so let's let him play,
Darling.

Oh, will the little Deku Scrub play
again?

Target shooting runs until tonight,
so why don't we let him play,
Darling?

Would you like to play?
This time it's special...

Today is Target Shooting day, isn't
it Darling?

But from what I can see, he
doesn't seem to have a bow,
Honey.

Oh my...Then he can't play today,
can he, Darling?

Oh, is this the one who got a
perfect score, Honey?
Do you want to play again?

The Bombchu Gallery runs until
tonight, doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, would you like to play?

The Bombchu Gallery runs until
tonight, doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, would you like to play?

Today is Bombchu Gallery day,
isn't it, Darling?

But from what I can see, he
doesn't seem to have a Bomb Bag,
Honey.

Oh my...Then he can't play today,
can he, Darling?

Did you just get a perfect score?
Do you want to play again?

Basket Bomb runs until tonight,
doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, are you the one who got a
perfect score yesterday? Do you
want to play again?

Basket Bomb runs until tonight,
doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, are you the one who got a
perfect score yesterday? Would
you like to play again?

Today is Basket Bomb day, isn't it
Darling?

Oh, would you like to play?

Basket Bomb runs until tonight,
doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, would you like to play?

Today is Basket Bomb day, isn't it
Darling?

Ahh! You again?
You still want to play?

.........

Oh, are you the one who just got
a perfect score? Would you like
to play again?

Target Shooting runs until tonight,
doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, are you the one who got a
perfect score two days in a row?
Do you want to play again?

Target Shooting runs until tonight,
doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, are you the one who got a
perfect score two days in a row?
Do you want to play again?

Today is Target Shooting day, isn't
it, Darling?

Oh, do you want to play again?

Target Shooting runs until tonight,
doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, aren't you...
You're the one who got a perfect
score before, right? Want to play
again?

Today is Target Shooting day, isn't
it, Darling?

Oh, do you want to play again?

Target Shooting runs until tonight,
doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, do you want to play?

Today is Target Shooting day, isn't
it, Darling?

What shall we do, Honey?
From what I can see, he doesn't
seem to be able to carry bombs.

Oh my...Then he can't play, can he,
Darling?

One game is 10 Rupees.
 
I'll play
I won't play

Honey, he says he isn't playing...

It looks like he doesn't have
enough Rupees. What shall we do,
Honey?

Goodbye!

Hit all the targets in the time it
takes us to dance through one
song.

But if you fall from this platform,
you're out. Isn't he, Darling?

Hit all the targets in the time it
takes us to dance through one
song.

But if you fall from this platform,
you're out. Isn't he, Darling?

Get a bomb inside every basket in
the time it takes us to dance
through one song.

If you throw with too much power,
you'll fall off this platform, so be
careful. Right, Darling?

Hit each target with a Bombchu in
the time it takes us to dance
through one song.

But if you fall off this platform,
you're out. Right, Darling?

Are you ready?
Start the music!

Did you see that? Honey, he got
a perfect score...

We have to share our happiness
with him, Honey.

That's annoying, so let's show off
even more for him, Darling.

H-H-Honey!!!
He...He got a perfect score three
days in a row.

This is all we have left to give
him, Honey.

I wonder...
Are we truly happy?
...Darling?

I wonder...
Are we truly happy?
...Darling?

Honey,
It's a perfect score again...

.........

All done.

It's already over, Honey.

For a while, it was like a dream,
Darling.

Oh, that's why I told you...

We've already won, Honey.

I'm happy, Darling.
